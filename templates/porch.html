    Ferdinand Porsche (1875–1951) founded the company called "Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche GmbH" with Adolf Rosenberger and Anton Piëch in 1931.
    The name is short for Ferdinand Porsche's full title in German, Doktor Ingenieur honoris causa lit. 'Doctor of Engineering, Honorary Degree'
    Ferdinand Porsche. The main offices was at Kronenstraße 24 in the centre of Stuttgart.[ Initially, the company offered motor vehicle
    development work and consulting, but did not build any cars under its own name. One of the first assignments the new company received was
    from the German government to design a car for the people; that is, a Volkswagen. This resulted in the Volkswagen Beetle, one of the most
    successful car designs of all time. Later, the Porsche 64 would be developed in 1939 using many components from the Beetle.
    During World War II, Volkswagen production turned to the military version of the Volkswagen Beetle, the Kübelwagen, 52,000 produced,
    and Schwimmwagen, 15,584 produced. Porsche produced several designs for heavy tanks during the war, losing out to Henschel & Son in both
    contracts that ultimately led to the Tiger I and the Tiger II. However, not all this work was wasted, as the chassis Porsche designed for the Tiger
   I was used as the base for
    the Elefant tank destroyer. Porsche also developed the Maus super-heavy tank in the closing stages of the war, producing
    two prototypes. Ferdinand Porsche's biographer, Fabian Müller, wrote that Porsche had thousands of people forcibly brought to work at their factories
    during the war. The workers wore the letter "P" on their clothing at all times. It stood not for "Porsche", but for "Poland".
    At the end of World War II in 1945, the Volkswagen factory at KdF-Stadt fell to the British. Ferdinand lost his position as chairman of the board of
    management of Volkswagen, and Ivan Hirst, a British Army major, was put in charge of the factory. (In Wolfsburg, the Volkswagen company magazine dubbed him "The British Major who saved Volkswagen".)
     On 15 December of that year, Ferdinand was arrested for war crimes, but not tried. During his 20-month imprisonment, Ferdinand Porsche's son, Ferry Porsche, decided to build his own car, because he
    could not find an existing one that he wanted to buy. He also had to steer the company through some of its most difficult days until his father's release in August 1947.
    The first models of what was to become the 356 were built in a small sawmill in Gmünd, Austria. The prototype car was shown to German auto dealers,
    and when pre-orders reached a set threshold, production (with aluminum body) was begun by Porsche Konstruktionen GesmbH, founded by Ferry and Louise.
    Many regard the 356 as the first Porsche simply because it was the first model sold by the fledgling company. After production of the 356 was taken over
    by the father's Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche GmbH in Stuttgart in 1950, Porsche commissioned a Zuffenhausen-based company, Reutter Karosserie, which had
    previously collaborated with the firm on Volkswagen Beetle prototypes, to produce the 356's steel body. In 1952, Porsche constructed an assembly plant
    (Werk 2) across the street from Reutter Karosserie; the main road in front of Werk 1, the oldest Porsche building, is now known as Porschestrasse. The 356 was

        In post-war Germany, parts were generally in short supply, so the 356 automobile used components from the Volkswagen Beetle, including the engine
        case from its internal combustion engine, transmission, and several parts used in the suspension. The 356, however, had several evolutionary stages,
        A, B, and C, while in production, and most Volkswagen-sourced parts were replaced by Porsche-made parts. Beginning in 1954 the 356s engines started
        utilizing engine cases designed specifically for the 356. The sleek bodywork was designed by Erwin Komenda, who also had designed the body of the Beetle.
        Porsche's signature designs have, from the beginning, featured air-cooled rear-engine configurations (like the Beetle), rare for other car manufacturers,
        but producing automobiles that are very well balanced.
        In 1964, after a fair amount of success in motor-racing with various models including the 550 Spyder, and with the 356 needing a major re-design,
        the company launched the Porsche 911: another air-cooled, rear-engined sports car, this time with a six-cylinder "boxer" engine. The team to lay
        out the body shell design was led by Ferry Porsche's eldest son, Ferdinand Alexander Porsche (F. A.). The design phase for the 911 caused internal
        problems with Erwin Komenda, who led the body design department until then. F. A. Porsche complained Komenda made unauthorized changes to the design.
        Company leader Ferry Porsche took his son's drawings to neighbouring chassis manufacturer Reuter. Reuter's workshop was later acquired by Porsche
        (so-called Werk 2). Afterward, Reuter became a seat manufacturer, today known as Keiper-Recaro.

       On 8 June 1948, the first car to bear the Porsche name was road-certified: the Porsche 356/1 Roadster
        produced in Gmünd (in Carinthia, Austria).The "Gmünd Roadster" was powered by a 1.1-liter air-cooled
        flat-four engine from Volkswagen. The engine's power was increased to 35 hp for the 356. The roadster
        weighed just 585 kilograms and reached speeds of up to 135 km/h (83 mph).

                    The Porsche 996 is the fifth generation of the 911 model sports car manufactured by the
                    German automaker Porsche from 1997 until 2006. It was replaced by the 997 in 2004,
                    but the high performance Turbo S, GT2 and GT3 variants remained in production until
                    2006. The 996 had little in common with its predecessor, with the first all new chassis
                    platform since the original 911 and a new water-cooled engine. Technically, it was a major
                    change, a complete break from the original car other than the overall layout.
